## Oyasumi nasai. It's 02:47 here and I need some shut eye before school tomorrow.

### Scene 1 - Chapter 1 (INCOMPLETE)

Two AM that day, I'd just woken from what should have been half an hour of shut-eye. I looked up around me... wondering how we'd worked in this place all through the day.

It was a mess. Papers scrunched up on the floor, bottles lying here and there -- and people, high-school students, all rolled up, sleeping on the floor, or in front of their screaming monitors.

Half dead.

Void of emotion whatsoever.

This is my class -- class 2-C. What a shame you had to meet them this way. We were in the middle of something important, so please overlook this.

Anyways.  I looked up at my computer -- enthusiasm lost, desperately wanting to just turn it off and go back to sleep... Why that feature wasn't working yet, I did not know.

Not that I could probably resolve it at that time.

From a corner of the poorly lit room I could hear a voice; I startled, but then slowly sank back into my non-existent bedding. That poor sod was sleep talking again...

If only the others were awake.

My name is Aurelie Gero. I write code.
